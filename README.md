# Reaper-Multi-Manager

The ultimate goal of this platform would be to facilitate better monitoring and risk management for Reaper and lower the technical barriers to strategy management.

Create an admin dashboard that would allow non-technical strategists to update multi-strategy allocations on any network. The dashboard should include data and visuals that allow strategists to determine the weight of assets allocated to each strategy and the vault, as well as information about the health of the target platformâ€™s reserves.
