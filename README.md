# Reaper-Multi-Manager

The ultimate goal of this platform would be to facilitate better monitoring and risk management for Reaper and lower the technical barriers to strategy management.

Create an admin dashboard that would allow non-technical strategists to update multi-strategy allocations on any network. The dashboard should include data and visuals that allow strategists to determine the weight of assets allocated to each strategy and the vault, as well as information about the health of the target platformâ€™s reserves.


## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
 - Yuvi's background in risk management and exploration of multi-strategy allocation management adds valuable insight and direction to the Reaper Multi-Manager project. His ongoing liaison with the Byte Masons will enhance the project's prospects for success.
 - Gerdus's background in front-end development and his ability to transform raw data into usable web applications will be valuable. This will help to create an intuitive interface that allows non-technical strategists to update multi-strategy allocations on any network.
 - Justin's expertise in DeFi, coupled with his profound knowledge of the company, product, and market landscape, aligns the Reaper Multi-Manager project with the company's vision and goals.

### Weaknesses
 - Yuvi has little software development experience, which could pose challenges in certain technical aspects of the project.
 - Gerdus has no experience in risk management or Byte Masons' products, possibly affecting his understanding and integration of these elements.
 - Large timezone discrepancies between Yuvi, Gerdus, and Justin may require asynchronous strategies, potentially complicating coordination and communication.

### Opportunities
  - The development of multi-strategy risk management infrastructure aligns well with market needs. This approach not only supports other products that leverage multi-strategy allocations but also builds investor trust. The high-order follow-on effects signify the potential for broader impact and acceptance within the target market.

### Threats
 - Implementing automation and trust-less controls for risk mitigation will slow down the project's progress, impacting timelines and deliverables.
 - The potential for scope creep, or uncontrolled changes and expansions in the project's objectives, could lead to delays and loss of focus, especially given the complexity of multi-strategy allocations.
 - The need to use third-party tools for indexing on-chain data presents a risk, as these tools may have limitations or the contract design itself might not provide all the necessary data. This dependency could constrain the project's functionality and efficiency.
